the app is for checking fingerprint throw cloud 
as we don't have any server for this app so we decided to use cloudsim plus API to simulate the cloud
it started by creating a datacenter with 1 host and 1 VM
then add our database to the host
then demand from user to enter his fingerprint
then the app will check if the fingerprint is in the database or not
at the end it will print the simularity percentage with each fingerprint in the database
